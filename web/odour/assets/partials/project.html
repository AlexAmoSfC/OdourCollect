  <h3 translate>The project</h3>

  <p translate>OdourCollect is the App to report your odour complaints. Use the power of your nose: Smell and share!</p>

  <p translate>Have you ever experience odour nuisance at home or at your working place? Do you know where to set up a complaint? Frequent exposure to annoying odours can cause headache, stress, and lack of concentration or respiratory problems, thus reducing your quality of life. Even though odour complaints are one of the main environmental problems in the EU, there is no specific regulation to control the problem, meaning that citizens are defenceless!</p>

  <p> translateOdourCollect provides a tool to empower citizens, who are suffering from regular odour nuisance, to report the incidence to the world. Odour maps are build based on crowd-sourced odour reports to calculate frequencies and levels of nuisance. Just log in and start reporting, anytime, everywhere! Your nose is indeed the best odour sensor available. Resulting odour maps are open for public consultation and could eventually be used to demonstrate the problem and ask for action to the relevant stakeholders, with the aim of eliminating or significantly reducing the nuisance, thus improving your quality of life.</p>

  <p translate>The project is being developed within the frame of MYGEOSS, a two-year European project (2015-2016) by the European Commission to develop GEOSS-based (Global Earth Observation System of Systems) smart Internet applications informing European citizens on the changes affecting their local environment. OdourCollect is one of the 13 winners from 15 European countries of the third MYGEOSS open call for innovative ideas. We need you for project success!</p>
