  <h3 translate>Methodology</h3>

  <p translate>OdourCollect is based on a standardized European methodology to evaluate odour episodes through crowd-sourced citizens' observations: the German standard VDI 3940:2006 (Measurement of odour impact by field inspection: measurement of the impact frequency of recognizable odours), which has become in the European standard CEN 16841.</p>

  <p translate>Although the standard defines a strict methodology to measure odours during a certain time in a specific area, where the nuisance is localised, with a specific duration and a certain number of measurements performed by certified standard human “noses” or observers, OdourCollect adapts the methodology with the aim of first identifying those complaint areas where the quality of life is jeopardised by frequent odour exposure. Any citizen can act as the observer and collect geo-localised open data on the odour episode, both in space and time, which can be used to build collaborative odour complaint maps. Yes, you too, since <strong>you have the best sensor to measure odours: your own nose!</strong> Yours' and your neighbours' observations will demonstrate the problem, which will empower citizens to claim for solutions and help them recovering their quality of life. Based on the identified odour complaint areas, scientific odour studies could be deployed on the area to technically characterise the odour problem and find the keys to minimise or eliminate it.</p>

  <p translate>Reporting an odour complaint with OdourCollect will take just a couple of minutes. After logging in (just choose a name or nickname and provide a valid e-mail address), you will need to fill in the following information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li translate>Location, day and hour of the odour perception (automatic field if you use the App for Android or the web from an iPhone; open field if you use a computer to register your odour episode)</li>

    <li>{{ 'Type of odour perceived (if known, you can always guess!). You can choose between:' | translate }}
      <ul>
        <li translate>Garbage</li>
        <li translate>Sewage</li>
        <li translate>Chemical</li>
        <li translate>I do not know</li>
        <li translate>Other</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>{{ 'Odour intensity, in a scale of 1 to 6, based on standard VDI 3882 Part 1: Determination of odour intensity:' | translate }}
      <ul>
        <li translate>1: Very weak (it is difficult to perceive it)</li>
        <li translate>2: Weak (almost everybody can notice an odour in the ambient air)</li>
        <li translate>3: Distinct (an odour is clearly present in the air by everybody)</li>
        <li translate>4: Strong (the odour starts to annoy)</li>
        <li translate>5: Very strong (the odour is clearly annoying)</li>
        <li translate>6: Extremely strong (the odour is almost unbearable)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li translate>Level of annoyance, from -4 (if the odour is unpleasant) to 0 (neutral) and to 4 (if the odour is pleasant), based on standard VDI 3882 Part 2: Determination of hedonic odour tone.</li>

    <li>{{ 'Meteorological conditions during the odour episode. Please observe:' | translate }}
      <ul>
        <li translate>Cloud coverage: from 0 to 8 (divide the sky in 8 parts and count how many of them are covered by clouds).</li>
        <li translate>Rain: from 0 to 5, being 5 a torrential rain.</li>
        <li translate>Wind: from 0 to 4, being 0 no wind, 1 very weak wind, 2 weak-distinct wind, 3 strong wind and 4 hurricane wind.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li translate>Where does the odour come from (if known or suspected)? This is important information to technically discover the odour source where to act.</li>

    <li>{{ 'Duration of the odour episode. Please select:' | translate }}
      <ul>
        <li translate>Less than 1 minute</li>
        <li translate>1 - 5 min</li>
        <li translate>More than 10 minutes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p translate>If you are not interested in reporting an odour episode but are curious about the odours perceived in your area, just check the map and the odour reports filled up by other citizens. You will be able to check on data intensity or level on annoyance, and to filter the map by type of odour or by date. Feel free to navigate and to become and odour hound!</p>

  <p translate>Thanks for participating in this citizen science experiment, helping us to build up collaborative odour maps!</p>
